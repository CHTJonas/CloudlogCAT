# CloudlogCAT

Windows app for providing CAT support for Cloudlog, this application uses the Omnirig (http://dxatlas.com/omnirig/) to interface to up to two radios at one time .

Note: Omnirig doesn't like GHz freqs I cant fix this, it will be addressed in V2 which is moving away from Omnirig for interfacing
